## THIS ACUALLY WORKS, You can chat with your friends over the internet using this.
### Do not use your real password. They are unsecured (stored on my server) I can view your passwords and users at any time. (Fix coming soon.)
When logging in with the new method, due to some bugs you must enter username, click enter and then click into password field.
Alternativly you can just use the old login that uses scratch's ask block.

Supporters can change their profile pictures by clicking the "Change PFP" button and choosing between AI to make a new image or uploading an existing one. Note: Uploading images requires you to store the image on a **URI** and upload that link to the app.

#ChatGPT Integration
ChatGPT 3.5, 4 and DALL-E are integrated into the chat as well, 3.5 is availible to all with 4 and DALL-E being for supporters. DALL-E is used for generating profile pictures when you don't know an image or have a URI. 4 is a channel labeled as "IkeGPT 4.0" or "PoshGPT 4.0". Please direct your attension to the above to see if AI function is working or not.
